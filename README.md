# simple-calculator
I have developed a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator includes number buttons, operator buttons, and an equal sign for performing calculations. A key feature of this project is the menu bar, through which users can view the calculation history. When the menu button is pressed, the history panel becomes visible in place of the calculator buttons, showing all previously performed operations in an organized way. This makes the calculator both functional and interactive by allowing users to easily review their past calculations.
